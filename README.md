# image-ai
AI image generation website that uses MERN stack and DALL-E API to share ai-generated images with the community!
## DEMO: [CLICK ME!](https://image-ai.glitch.me/)
As this project is hosted for free, the backend sleeps after a period of inactivity and needs some time to relaunch. Please give it a minute or two for the backend to be restarted again.
### What is this website?
image-ai is a website that lets users obtain AI-generated images using DALL-E from OpenAI.
### Tech Stack
I used Vite.js for ease of project management and initialization boilerplate.
Tailwind CSS is used for simple and concise in-line component styling, and React.js for all of the client's frontend code.
The server's backend is constructed using MongoDB for data storage, Node.js, and Express.js for endpoint and routing management.
